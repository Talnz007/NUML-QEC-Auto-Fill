Auto Evaluation Script

This repository contains a template script for automating course evaluations by setting radio inputs and filling out textareas with a predefined evaluation text.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Select Radio Inputs:**
   - The script selects all radio input elements with a specific value and clicks each one to set its value.
   - **To set the rating value:** Change the value in `input[type='radio'][value='5']` to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 based on your rating.

2. **Fill Textareas:**
   - The script selects all textarea elements on the page and appends a predefined evaluation text to each one.
   - **To customize the review text:** Modify the `const evaluationText` variable in the script to match your own review.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Evaluation Form:**
   - Navigate to the web page where you want to run the script (e.g., a course evaluation form).

2. **Open the Browser's Developer Console:**
   - Usually, you can open the console by pressing `F12` or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect", then going to the "Console" tab.

3. **Copy and Paste the Script:**
   - Copy the entire script from `auto-evaluation-script.js`.
   - Paste the script into the console and press `Enter`.

## Example Script

```javascript
// This script automatically selects radio buttons and fills out textareas on a course evaluation form.

// Select all radio input elements with a value of 5 (you can change the value to 1, 2, 3, or 4 if needed)
const radioInputs = document.querySelectorAll("input[type='radio'][value='5']");

// Click each radio input to set its value
radioInputs.forEach(input => input.click());

// Select all textarea elements on the page
const textAreas = document.querySelectorAll("textarea");

// Define the evaluation text to be inserted into each textarea
// You can customize this text to match your review
